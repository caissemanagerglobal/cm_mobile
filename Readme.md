## Mobile Developer Coding Test: POS App Interface with JSON Server

**Objective:** Develop a mobile application interface that simulates a POS platform for purchasing products.

### Test Screens:
Refer to the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/BWSSd2UkDX66jtSsMZ46qR/MobileDevTest?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=XyND2XVML1UJpooV-1) for layout and design specifics.

### Test Screens:
1. **Product Listing Page**
   - Displays a grid of products.
   - Each product tile shows the product name and price (e.g., "Espresso 24 Dhs").
   - Implement a search bar with placeholder text "Chercher un produit ..." and a "Chercher" button.

2. **Product Detail Page**
   - Shows details for a selected product.
   - Includes product name and quantity selection with minus (-), input, and plus (+) buttons.
   - Price per unit is displayed (e.g., "1 x 24 Dhs / u").

### Requirements:
- Use a JSON server to mock backend functionality.
- Handle state management for quantity selection and search functionality.
- Follow component structure and navigation best practices.
- Manage asynchronous data with loading states.
- Implement responsive design for different device sizes.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Provide a GitHub repository link.
- Include README with setup and run instructions.
- Ensure the JSON server is deployable with the provided dataset.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Code quality and organization.
- JSON server integration.
- User interface design and responsiveness.
- Functionality according to requirements.

Good luck with your implementation! Attention to detail and code readability are essential.
